Giftastic What?

This is an application that works with the Giphy API.

Why?

In this application Mr. Fluffers would like to create his dream grocery cart scenario, in it you will click buttons with food names that will produce giphys of the same food that will appear in his grocery cart. In the grocery cart you can click on the giphys to make them animate, and click them again to make them still. You can also make new buttons of food that you would like to recommend Mr. Fluffers for his dream. He is not picky.

There is also a favorites section where you can add your favorite buttons and also remove them if you wish.
